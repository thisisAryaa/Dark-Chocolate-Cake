	This super moist dark chocolate  cake combines unsweetened natural cocoa powder and dark cocoa powder for an extra rich flavor. Fill the cake with a simplified chocolate and cover the whole dessert with semi-sweet chocolate ganache. If needed, you can prepare the ganache and mousse ahead of time.

	Chocolate  is simple divinity in its own right, but when paired with chocolate cake, it’s downright decadent.

	I made this chocolate mousse cake for my Parent's Anniversary. This cake basically demands a huge gathering because– trust me– you don’t want to be left alone with its temptation. It WILL call out your name each time you open the refrigerator.
